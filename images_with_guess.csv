Explanation: The butterfly in the image appears to be a member of the genus Heliconius, which is a diverse and brightly colored group of butterflies commonly known as longwings or heliconians. This particular butterfly resembles the species Heliconius hecale based on its wing pattern: bright orange with black vein markings and white spots near the tips of its wings. However, it's important to note that butterfly identification can be complex due to the existence of many similar-looking species and subspecies, along with regional variations in color and pattern. Therefore, without more detailed information or examination by a lepidopterist, identifying the exact species from an image alone is not always definitive."
